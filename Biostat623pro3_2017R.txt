Survival in Diffuse Histiocytic Lymphoma
Learning Objectives:
Students who successfully complete this section will be able to:
 Translate survival time data into groups that allow calculation of crude incidence rates.
 Analyze the grouped survival time data using log-linear Poisson regression models.
 Analyze the survival time data (without grouping) by the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the
survival function, the log- rank statistic and Cox proportional hazards model.
 Check the estimated model for its consistency with the observed data; in particular, check the
proportional hazards assumption using the complementary log-log plot of the estimated
survival function.
 Summarize the findings for public health readers and document and archive the steps of the
statistical analysis by creating an R script file.
Data Set:
Below find the survival times in days for two groups of patients with diffuse
histiocytic lymphoma. The data are stored in the csv data set lymphoma.csv, which may be
downloaded from the course website.
One group has Stage-3 cancer (stage = 0); the second group (stage =1) has Stage-4 cancer. The
question of interest is whether stage at diagnosis predicts survival time.
Times to Death(days)
Stage 3 (stage=0)

6, 19, 32, 42, 42, 43*, 94, 126, 169*, 207, 211*, 227*, 253, 255*,
270*, 310*, 316*, 335*, 346*

Stage 4 (stage=1) 4, 10, 11, 13, 31, 40, 50, 56, 68, 82, 85, 93, 175, 247*, 291*, 345*
*= censored (alive at the end of follow-up)
Methods:
a. An alternative to calculating Kaplan-Meier estimates of the survival curve is to calculate lifetable estimates when the time intervals are grouped or binned. Using the lymphoma.csv
data set, we could divide the total time of exposure into roughly ten bins and determine the
numbers of deaths and person-days experienced for each of the two groups in each bin. For
example, (0-7] is the bin from 0 up to but not including 7 days.
Assume the following bins: (0-7], (7-15], (15-30], (30-60], (60-90], (90-120], (120-150],
(150-180], (180-270], (270-360]

b. Download the csv data set binlymph.csv from CoursePlus. Verify that the calculations
of total time of exposure and person-days experienced appears to be correct by reviewing the
contents of this dataset. Also, using R create a plot of S(t) –vs.- mid_days for each group.
library(tidyverse)
binData = read_csv("binlymph.csv")
print(binData)
qplot(x=mid_days, y=Survival,
col=factor(stage, labels=c("Stage 3", "Stage 4")),
data=binData) + geom_line() + labs(col="Cancer Stage")

c. Recall that D is the number of deaths, P_Days is the person-days accumulated in the bin and
mid_days is the midpoint of time bin. Rename variables for simplicity:
binData = binData %>%
mutate(t = mid_days) %>%
mutate(N = P_Days)

d. Fit the following four log-linear Poisson regression models to the grouped survival data
log EYi =

Model
A:

log Ni + β0 + β1stage

B:

log Ni + β0 + β1stage + β2(t-60)

C:

log Ni + β0 + β1stage + β2(t-60) + β3(t-60)+

D:

log Ni + β0 + β1stage+ β2(t-60) + β3(t-60)+ +β4(t-60)*stage+ β5(t-60)+*stage

e. Generate time terms, centered and spline:
binData = binData %>%
mutate(t60 = t-60) %>%
mutate(t60sp = ifelse(t > 60, t-60, 0))

f. Generate interaction terms: We don’t need to do this in R, since we can include the
interaction directly in our model.
g. Fit the models:
# Model A: stage
modelA = glm(D ~ stage, offset=log(N),
family=poisson(link="log"), data=binData)
summary(modelA)
modelA$coefficients; confint.default(modelA) ## coefficients
exp(modelA$coefficients); exp(confint.default(modelA)) ## IRR
# Model B: stage + t-60

modelB = glm(D ~ stage + t60, offset=log(N),
family=poisson(link="log"), data=binData)
summary(modelB)
modelB$coefficients; confint.default(modelB) ## coefficients
exp(modelB$coefficients); exp(confint.default(modelB)) ## IRR
# Model C: stage + t-60 + (t-60)^+
modelC = glm(D ~ stage + t60 + t60sp, offset=log(N),
family=poisson(link="log"), data=binData)
summary(modelC)
modelC$coefficients; confint.default(modelC) ## coefficients
# Model D: stage + t-60 + (t-60)^+ + stage*(t•60) + stage*(t•60)^+
modelD = glm(D ~ stage + t60 + t60sp + stage:t60 + stage:t60sp,
offset=log(N), family=poisson(link="log"), data=binData)
summary(modelD)
modelD$coefficients; confint.default(modelD) ## coefficients

h. Use the AIC = -2 log likelihood + 2(# of parameters) to identify the “best” prediction
model from among A-D. Interpret the model results in a few sentences, as if for a journal
article.
AIC(modelA, modelB, modelC, modelD)

i. Now use the csv data set lymphoma.csv. Calculate Kaplan-Meier (K-M) estimates of
the survival curve with 95% CI separately for each group. Plot the K-M curves against time.
lymphData = read_csv("lymphoma.csv")
head(lymphData)
library(survival)
lymphData$SurvObj = with(lymphData, Surv(days, died == 1))
km.stage = survfit(SurvObj ~ stage, data = lymphData,
type="kaplan-meier", conf.type="log-log")
summary(km.stage)
plot(km.stage, col=c("blue","red"),
main="Kaplan-Meier survival estimates by cancer stage",
ylab="S(t)", xlab="time" )
legend("bottomleft", c("Stage 3", "Stage 4"),
col=c("blue", "red"), lty=1)

j. Compare the K-M curves versus the display of S(t) – vs- mid_days that you produced in
step a.
k. Carry out a log-rank test and determine a p-value for the null hypothesis that the two
population survival curves are the same for Stage 4 -vs- Stage 3 patients. What do you
conclude?

l. Fit a Cox proportional hazards model with an arbitrary baseline hazard and a group effect for
stage
model1 = coxph(SurvObj ~ stage, data =
summary(model1)

lymphData, ties="breslow")

m. Compare the results of the log-rank test from part k. with the corresponding test for the Cox
model in part l. Do they differ enough to change interpretation?
n. Create an R script file that documents and archives the steps of your statistical analysis. This
file will make your analysis “reproducible.”
